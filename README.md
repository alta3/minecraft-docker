minecraft-docker
================

Minecraft and Minecraft Mapper Docker project that shows off volumes. This project will run Minecraft, Minecraft mapper, andd a busybox web server all in three docker containers. The code is reasonably commented so you can study it. It is working on my system right now, but this code still needs to be tested. I hope you have fun with trying it out.
